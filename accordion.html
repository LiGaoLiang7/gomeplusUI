                <p style="line-height:1.6rem;">Having a job is not a bad idea. It puts food on your table, it pays your bills.
                    <br/>Your dad/mum is right. Believe me, they're right with most of the things you don't believe in.
                    <br/>There is nothing as overnight success. Work hard for your goals.
                    <br/>You might still fail even when you work fucking hard. The truth is, you don't have absolute control over anything. So, be flexible.
                    <br/>Your family members are the most important people in your life. Respect them, in most cases, they matter more than your friends.
                    <br/>You're going to fail hard. You will, take it as your achievement.
                    <br/>No one cares. Except your parents, even your friends might not care.
                    <br/>No one will help you. Only you can help yourself.
                    <br/>This is not the time for you to ruin your body. Take good care of your body, you can't undo the damages in your 30s and 40s.
                    <br/>Don't waste time. Same with your health, you can't gain it back.
                    <br/>You're responsible for everything. Don't push them to anyone else.
                    <br/>He/she might not be the one. You might experience serious heartbreak, but it's not the end of the world.
                    <br/>You need to stop complaining. It does nothing and changes nothing.
                    <br/>Start budgeting. Money is fucking important, learn to manage it.
                    <br/>Read more. It’s time to communicate with solid substance.
                    <br/>You're not that special. If you really want to become someone, work for it.
                    <br/>Your weaknesses don't matter. So, please don't be afraid to make mistakes. No one expects you to be perfect.
                    <br/>It's not the last 3 years of your life. Don't live in a hurry.
                    <br/>Consistency is the key. Every achievement requires the test of time, master something with consistency.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p style="line-height:1.6rem;">Cool Q! Here are my 10 answers. They are based on my experience and although they might seem like "hey, everyone knows it", the truth is that most people don't implement them, forget about them and realize later than they should. It is also good reminder to all of us. So here we go.
                    <br>You are the only one responsible for yourself and for your success. I am responsible for mine. Thinking anything else is wasting your energy. So don't blame your parents, spouse, children, friends, aunts and uncles. It is you, you and only you.
                    <br>Life is short. There are no special occasions. Don't wait for them. Today is the special occasion. Buy yourself an ice cream/beer/ wear that nice shirt. Today!
                    <br>If something bothers you change it. If it is beyond your control, learn to live with it. Accept it. Change yourself. That is the only thing you can influence.
                    <br>You will regret the things you didn't do much more than ones you did. So... action!
                    <br>"Future you", imaginary person that has perfect weight, looks great, gets up early, smiles and loves his/her job, will never become as great if "present you" don't do something.
                    <br>Prioritize your health, rest and happiness. No one will do that for you. There will always be more work.
                    <br>Don't ruin your health in order to earn money. You will end up spending your money to recover your health and that is not reciprocal.
                    <br>Besides of 1. and 3. the biggest time and energy wasters are: TV, people pleasing, perfectionism, envy, regret, obsessive dieting and house cleaning. You can refocus your time and energy in so much better ways.
                    <br>We tend to overestimate what we can do in a day and to underestimate what we can do in a year (or a lifetime). Start today, start small. Drops will fill the bucket.
                    <br>If you waste money, you can earn it again. If you miss the moment, it can never be returned. Live life with opened eyes, ears, heart!
                    <br>EXTRA: "It is too late," is just an excuse. You can always change the course. You can always reinvent yourself.
                    <br>I hope my answers were inspiring! :)</p>

            <div class="title"><i class="dropdown icon"></i>What are some of the best life tips?</div>
            <div class="content">
                <p style="line-height:1.6rem;">Start before you’re ready. I spent 4 minutes and 12 seconds try to craft a perfect answer for this question. But you’re reading this because my mind finally said f*ck it, and start writing.
                    <br>Don’t stop when you’re tired/upset/exhausted, stop when you’re done. By stop, I mean stop trying and telling yourself it’s done before it’s actually done. It’s not, challenges, failures and setbacks are temporary. Now, move on!
                    <br>Everything comes with a price. Literally, everything. If you’re not up to pay the price, don’t complain about not getting what you want in life.
                    <br>Stop complaining. It changes nothing at all. Oh no… It does. It annoys the hell out of others and makes you feel worse.
                    <br>Stop comparing. We have very little (if not none) of information to make a rational comparison. In most cases, we are evaluating our worst with others’ best when you’re comparing.
                    <br>Get enough sleep. We need at least 7 to 8 hours sleep a day, only a minority need less than that… Like, maybe 5% of all human being. You won’t know if you’re one of them. When you know it, it’s too late. Read about sleep debt here.
                    <br>Detach your emotions with external things. Because they don’t last. You’re going to feel extremely bad if you’re depending your happiness on them (people and things).
                    <br>Read real books. Do deep instead of shallow. The Internet trained us to go shallow.
                    <br>Reduce multitasking. It doesn’t boost your productivity. Instead, it drains your energy and focus.
                    <br>Start your day the night before. Plan for the next day before you go to bed. This gives you a reason to get off the bed next morning.
                    <br>Relationship is the place to give (not receive). If you were wondering why your spouse never did this (or that) for you, that’s exactly why.
                    <br>Take tiny actions, celebrate small wins. Small actions have lower resistance, start doing something small is 1,000,000x better off than doing nothing. Then, train yourself to appreciate small progress.
                    <br>Say “get to” instead of “have to”. Change your vocabulary and start appreciate everything happen for you.
                    <br>Do something that scares you. Get out from your comfort zone, set bigger goals, and do it. You’re reading this right now because someone else once thought that the personal computer was possible.
                    <br>If you spent $750 for something originally at $1,000, you just spent $750, not saved $250. Face the truth, never find excuses, especially when it comes to money.
                    <br>Remove that tiny red dot on the corner of you apps icon. If you’re using Android, see here; for iOS, see here. I believe you know why.
                    <br>Listen first before speaking. You learn nothing if you’re the only one speaking.
                    <br>Start selling. I won’t say start a business, but everyone of us is selling in some way. So, learn how to do it.
                    <br>Your customer is always right if you want his/her money. In case you’re in a business, this is the truth, by Gary Vaynerchuk
                    <br>Take good care of your body. Everything will not be relevant without your physical body (at least until someone invent a way to upload us to a server… maybe…)
                    <br>Fail hard, fail often. That’s how we learn the most. Be proud of it, take it as an achievement.
                    <br>Contribute more. I’m not exactly sure why, but I learned this from successful people I’m following. Probably because it puts a smile on others’ face.
                    <br>Judge others on their intention, evaluate yourself with the results. If you need to judge others, do it based on their intention, because again, we don’t know their own set of constraints and challenges.
                    <br>His/her/my tips might not be the right tips for you. Explore, experience, learn and most importantly enjoy life yourself.
                    <br>The guaranteed way to increase your luck is to increase the times you bet. I’m not asking you to get involve in gambling. My point is, a master art piece is created after thousand shitty ones before it. So, be consistency on your output rather than thinking about how to strike a home-run in one single shot.</p>

                <p style="line-height:1.6rem;">Cool Q! Here are my 10 answers. They are based on my experience and although they might seem like "hey, everyone knows it", the truth is that most people don't implement them, forget about them and realize later than they should. It is also good reminder to all of us. So here we go.
                    <br>You are the only one responsible for yourself and for your success. I am responsible for mine. Thinking anything else is wasting your energy. So don't blame your parents, spouse, children, friends, aunts and uncles. It is you, you and only you.
                    <br>Life is short. There are no special occasions. Don't wait for them. Today is the special occasion. Buy yourself an ice cream/beer/ wear that nice shirt. Today!
                    <br>If something bothers you change it. If it is beyond your control, learn to live with it. Accept it. Change yourself. That is the only thing you can influence.
                    <br>You will regret the things you didn't do much more than ones you did. So... action!
                    <br>"Future you", imaginary person that has perfect weight, looks great, gets up early, smiles and loves his/her job, will never become as great if "present you" don't do something.
                    <br>Prioritize your health, rest and happiness. No one will do that for you. There will always be more work.
                    <br>Don't ruin your health in order to earn money. You will end up spending your money to recover your health and that is not reciprocal.
                    <br>Besides of 1. and 3. the biggest time and energy wasters are: TV, people pleasing, perfectionism, envy, regret, obsessive dieting and house cleaning. You can refocus your time and energy in so much better ways.
                    <br>We tend to overestimate what we can do in a day and to underestimate what we can do in a year (or a lifetime). Start today, start small. Drops will fill the bucket.
                    <br>If you waste money, you can earn it again. If you miss the moment, it can never be returned. Live life with opened eyes, ears, heart!
                    <br>EXTRA: "It is too late," is just an excuse. You can always change the course. You can always reinvent yourself.
                    <br>I hope my answers were inspiring! :)</p>

            <div class="title"><i class="dropdown icon"></i>What are some of the best life tips?</div>
            <div class="content">
                <p style="line-height:1.6rem;">Start before you’re ready. I spent 4 minutes and 12 seconds try to craft a perfect answer for this question. But you’re reading this because my mind finally said f*ck it, and start writing.
                    <br>Don’t stop when you’re tired/upset/exhausted, stop when you’re done. By stop, I mean stop trying and telling yourself it’s done before it’s actually done. It’s not, challenges, failures and setbacks are temporary. Now, move on!
                    <br>Everything comes with a price. Literally, everything. If you’re not up to pay the price, don’t complain about not getting what you want in life.
                    <br>Stop complaining. It changes nothing at all. Oh no… It does. It annoys the hell out of others and makes you feel worse.
                    <br>Stop comparing. We have very little (if not none) of information to make a rational comparison. In most cases, we are evaluating our worst with others’ best when you’re comparing.
                    <br>Get enough sleep. We need at least 7 to 8 hours sleep a day, only a minority need less than that… Like, maybe 5% of all human being. You won’t know if you’re one of them. When you know it, it’s too late. Read about sleep debt here.
                    <br>Detach your emotions with external things. Because they don’t last. You’re going to feel extremely bad if you’re depending your happiness on them (people and things).
                    <br>Read real books. Do deep instead of shallow. The Internet trained us to go shallow.
                    <br>Reduce multitasking. It doesn’t boost your productivity. Instead, it drains your energy and focus.
                    <br>Start your day the night before. Plan for the next day before you go to bed. This gives you a reason to get off the bed next morning.
                    <br>Relationship is the place to give (not receive). If you were wondering why your spouse never did this (or that) for you, that’s exactly why.
                    <br>Take tiny actions, celebrate small wins. Small actions have lower resistance, start doing something small is 1,000,000x better off than doing nothing. Then, train yourself to appreciate small progress.
                    <br>Say “get to” instead of “have to”. Change your vocabulary and start appreciate everything happen for you.
                    <br>Do something that scares you. Get out from your comfort zone, set bigger goals, and do it. You’re reading this right now because someone else once thought that the personal computer was possible.
                    <br>If you spent $750 for something originally at $1,000, you just spent $750, not saved $250. Face the truth, never find excuses, especially when it comes to money.
                    <br>Remove that tiny red dot on the corner of you apps icon. If you’re using Android, see here; for iOS, see here. I believe you know why.
                    <br>Listen first before speaking. You learn nothing if you’re the only one speaking.
                    <br>Start selling. I won’t say start a business, but everyone of us is selling in some way. So, learn how to do it.
                    <br>Your customer is always right if you want his/her money. In case you’re in a business, this is the truth, by Gary Vaynerchuk
                    <br>Take good care of your body. Everything will not be relevant without your physical body (at least until someone invent a way to upload us to a server… maybe…)
                    <br>Fail hard, fail often. That’s how we learn the most. Be proud of it, take it as an achievement.
                    <br>Contribute more. I’m not exactly sure why, but I learned this from successful people I’m following. Probably because it puts a smile on others’ face.
                    <br>Judge others on their intention, evaluate yourself with the results. If you need to judge others, do it based on their intention, because again, we don’t know their own set of constraints and challenges.
                    <br>His/her/my tips might not be the right tips for you. Explore, experience, learn and most importantly enjoy life yourself.
                    <br>The guaranteed way to increase your luck is to increase the times you bet. I’m not asking you to get involve in gambling. My point is, a master art piece is created after thousand shitty ones before it. So, be consistency on your output rather than thinking about how to strike a home-run in one single shot.</p>
